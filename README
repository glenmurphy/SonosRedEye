Description

Inspired by Brad Fitzpatrick <https://github.com/bradfitz/sonden>, this NodeJS
script watches my Sonos and uses my Thinkflood RedEye to turn my receiver on
and to the Sonos input when music is playing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration

You'll need to fill out the IP addresses of your devices in the source.

To get the REDEYE_PATHs, you need to download the control database from 
your RedEye <http://[REDEYEIP]/setup/maintenance.html>, then use 
SQLLiteExplorer to find the 'signal' value for the commands you need
in the 'command' table. The final URL is constructed using that value
in the following:

  "/cgi-bin/play_iph.sh?/[SIGNALPATH]%201"

You're meant to be able to use the iOS app to extract these paths, but I could
never get that to work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation

You can run this as a service on Windows using NSSM <http://nssm.cc>:

    nssm.exe install sonos-node "C:\path\to\node.exe" c:\path\to\sonos.js
    net start sonos-node
